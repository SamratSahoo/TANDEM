"""Teleoperation + capture driver for the data-collection app's teleop flow.

Drives the arm from either the **VR** (Oculus) controller — same as ``scripts/main.py`` — or a
**SpaceMouse** (``--device``), and captures each episode from the browser exactly like the tamp/eval
capture drivers (events-file + stdin protocol, see ``data-collection/ARCHITECTURE.md`` §6). The operator
moves the end-effector with the chosen controller (6-DOF -> Cartesian velocity) and works the gripper
(VR trigger, or the SpaceMouse's two buttons); the operator decides when each episode ends (from the
UI). Every episode is written in the raw episode format (§3) so ``collect/build_lerobot.py`` builds it
exactly like a tamp episode.

Unlike the old ``scripts/main.py`` + Tk GUI VR flow, session control (start / end / discard / label) is
driven over the stdin protocol from the browser for BOTH devices — the controller only moves the arm.

Nothing is installed on the NUC — this is a drop-in for the existing PC-side teleop (still talks to the
NUC's ``run_server.py`` over the same ``StableRobotEnv`` -> ServerInterface path); only the controller
changes. VR uses ``droid.controllers.oculus_controller.VRPolicy``; the SpaceMouse is read
dependency-free (see ``spacemouse.py``).

Protocol (stdin lines written by the Node server):
  {"cmd":"start"}   begin an episode (at the task prompt)
  {"cmd":"end"}     stop + SAVE the current episode        {"cmd":"discard"} stop + throw it away
  {"cmd":"home"}    send the arm to its home pose (only at the task prompt, between episodes)
  {"cmd":"end_and_quit"}  stop + SAVE, then finish the session -- what "return control to TAMP"
                    sends mid-recording, since a bare "q" there DISCARDS the episode
  y | n             label the saved episode success/failure   q  finish the session

With --trajectory-id (a tamp->teleop hand-off), episodes are legs of that tamp trajectory: they are
stamped with the id, left unlabeled in eval/, and never prompt for y/n. See ARCHITECTURE.md §6c.

The arm also returns home automatically at the END of every trajectory (after save / discard / error),
so it is clear of the workspace before the next episode; the home motion is not part of the recording.

Events (appended to $TELEOP_EVENTS_FILE): session_start, awaiting_task, rollout_start, rollout_saved,
awaiting_label, labeled, rollout_aborted, homing, homed, session_end.

Run under the DROID conda env (same as the VR ``scripts/main.py``).
