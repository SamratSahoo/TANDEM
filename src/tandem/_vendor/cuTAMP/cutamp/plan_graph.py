"""
Graph representation of a TAMP plan.

A cuTAMP plan skeleton is, structurally, a **bipartite factor graph**: the continuous
decision variables (configurations, poses, grasps, trajectories) and the physical objects
(movables, surfaces, buttons) are the *variable* nodes, while the constraints and costs that
couple them are the *factor* nodes. The task-level operators own those factors and impose a
temporal ordering. This module materializes that structure into a serializable graph so it can
be inspected, visualized, or analyzed offline.

The graph is emitted as a JSON node-link document (see :func:`build_plan_graph`) and,
optionally, as a Graphviz DOT file for visualization. No third-party graph library is required;
:func:`to_networkx` is provided as a convenience if ``networkx`` happens to be installed.

Node kinds
----------
- ``operator``   : one per ground operator in the skeleton (ordered by plan step).
- ``variable``   : one per distinct parameter value. ``var_class`` is either ``decision``
                   (conf/pose/grasp/traj — optimized) or ``object`` (movable/surface/button).
- ``constraint`` : one per ground constraint (a hard factor that must be satisfied).
- ``cost``       : one per ground cost (a soft factor that is minimized).

Edge relations (``rel``)
------------------------
- ``precedes``         : operator -> next operator (plan order).
- ``uses``             : operator -> variable it is parameterized by.
- ``owns_constraint``  : operator -> constraint it introduces.
- ``owns_cost``        : operator -> cost it introduces.
- ``constrains``       : constraint -> variable in its scope.
- ``affects``          : cost -> variable in its scope.

# The plan graph is a bipartite factor graph; the survey draws two views of it:
#   * Figure 8 -- the *plan skeleton* as a **dynamic factor graph**: one column
#     per state s0..sk, one row per state variable (robot config, holding, object
#     poses) with the motion parameters on a partial top row; round nodes are state
#     variables (grey = constant, colored = free), rectangles are the constraints
#     between adjacent states, and thick black lines are equality constraints that
#     persist a variable's value across steps.
#   * Figure 9 -- the *simplified constraint network*: a bipartite graph from the
#     (geometric) free parameters to the constraints, with constants/objects and
#     redundant structure removed.
# ``build_skeleton_layout`` reconstructs both from a plan graph by simulating the
# operator effects, so the interactive HTML can render them faithfully.

# One distinct color per free (decision) variable, cycled. Constants render grey.
