    Returns True when the operator ended the trajectory from teleop ("resume_finish") rather than
    handing it back to be replanned: their demonstration finished the task, so the caller closes the
    trajectory out instead of queueing another rollout. Returns False for a plain "resume", which is
    the unchanged behaviour -- replan the same task from the hand-off pose.

    `can_finish` says whether the caller HAS a partial rollout to close out. Only the mid-rollout
    hand-off does; the ones taken at a prompt or after a preempt have no leg to label and no
    trajectory to end, so they advertise `can_finish: false` and downgrade a "resume_finish" to a
    plain resume rather than stranding the operator.

    Called at a rollout checkpoint (see _sigusr1_teleop_switch), so the current plan step has already
    finished and this rollout's partial episode is already on disk. From here:
      1. release this process's RobotClient connection so a separate teleop process (DROID's
         StableRobotEnv) can take over the arm -- they talk to the same NUC-side polymetis server and
         cannot hold it at once (see data-collection/ARCHITECTURE.md).
      2. confirm the arm has ACTUALLY stopped moving (wait_for_robot_stationary) before anyone is
         told it's safe to touch the shim -- releasing our connection does not mean the shim is
         done: it still has to finish the in-flight trajectory segment and hand control back to
         polymetis's default hold controller, which takes real time. Skipping this check would let
         an operator kill the shim (or start teleop) while the arm is still moving.
      3. release the ZED cameras too (_release_cameras) -- teleop opens the same serials. This runs
         AFTER the stationary check so a "could not confirm the arm stopped" warning reaches the
         operator immediately, rather than behind several seconds of camera teardown.
      4. emit "awaiting_teleop_resume" so the data-collection server knows it's safe to start the
         teleop session, then block on stdin for "resume" (written once the operator hands control
         back and the teleop process has exited, releasing the arm and the cameras).
      5. re-open the cameras, reconnect the RobotClient, and queue the SAME task instruction with
         _skip_episode_reset so the next loop iteration replans from the hand-off pose without
         moving the arm first -- no return to home, no gripper open, no move to the capture pose.
         The task plan this rollout was following is queued with it (_reuse_plan_skeleton), so the
         resumed rollout re-solves the motion for the SAME plan rather than searching for another.
         Skipped entirely when the operator chose to finish: nothing is queued, and the caller
         labels the partial leg instead.
