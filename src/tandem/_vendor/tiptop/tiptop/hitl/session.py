"""The HITL session: one task's phases, walked one rollout at a time.

A HITL task is not one rollout. Each robot phase is an ordinary TiPToP rollout aimed at that phase's
sub-goal, and each human phase is a teleop leg -- so the plan has to survive the hand-off between
them. tiptop_run is a single long-lived process, so this state lives here and is keyed on the
trajectory it belongs to; anything that ends the trajectory ends the session with it.
